         <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>QR Code stands for "Quick Response" Code. <br>While they may look simple, QR codes are capable of storing lots of data. QR codes are frequently used to track information about products in a supply chain.
            <br>Therefore, We have choosen this as our Minor project because in the packaging field the use of QR codes is increasing continuously.</p>
